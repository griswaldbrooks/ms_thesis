\chapter{Crawl Gait Results} \label{ch:results_crawl_gait}

% The structure of this chapter needs revision.

% What do we have to talk about here?
% Well, I suppose the point of this chapter is to present how well the algorithm worked.
% What is there to present?
% I suppose it should be shown that the crawl gait does indeed crawl the robot,
% as that is not necessarily assumed in the chapter explaining the gait.
% Some things you might want to know:
% How fast did the robot go?
% How high?
% What was the torque usage?
