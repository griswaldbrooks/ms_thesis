Real-time path planning is a necessity for any autonomous mobile robot operating in unknown environments. This report describes an implementation of the Game-Theoretic Optimal Deformable Zone with Inertia and Local Approach (GODZILA) path planning algorithm on the Nao humanoid robot by Aldebaran Robotics. The algorithm is a lightweight local path planner that does not require building an environment map. Forward facing ultrasonic distance sensors on the Nao were used for occlusion detection. Theory, simulation, and implementation results will be discussed.
