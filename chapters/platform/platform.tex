\chapter{Platform}\label{ch:platform}

For this thesis we used the Nao as the mobile platform. Aldebaran makes him.
He's a cool little robot and he allows us to explore both things we wanted to 
look at which were navigation and gaiting. He's mobile, small, ``cost-effective''
and has a good API that we can use to do lower-level control of things when we want to, 
and abstract ourselves from it when we don't want to.
The small size means he's easy to work with.

There's definitely some more opening paragraph to be written here about the Nao.
Probably say something about why he's useful to investigate crawling.
No one's going to send Nao into a disaster zone or anything but he's not too
far off from robots that you would send in and we don't have to spend all the 
money or build a new lab to work with him. You can do lot's of simulations, 
but in the end you still have to test on a real robot.

While the Nao is cool and all, the sonar sensors just don't cut it for what we want to do.
Lucky, Nao comes with a USB port and uses x86 and linux so it's relatively
straightforward to add new things to him. Therefore, we added a better distance sensor.
Specifically we added the Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01.
It's a good Lidar because it has a respectable range, good angular resolution,
``cost-effective'', and is kinda lightweight. Using this sensor we could do mapping 
if we wanted to which means this system is extensible to the broader challenges 
of the overall navigation problem such as SLAM\@. Using the Lidar we'll be able to 
get enough information to do the job we need to.

While it's easy to plug a USB cable into Nao's head, you still have to stick the Lidar somewhere.
Nao doesn't have mount points that make it easy to add new hardware.
Given that we have a nifty 3D printer (and I know Solidworks) we designed up a little suit of
armor for Nao with a big stick coming out of it that we could mount the Lidar to, above his head.
This works but the new dynamics destabilize Nao's default gait at certain speeds. 
This doesn't mess with the navigation algorithm, but to increase the speed this will have to be dealt with,
either by changing the rig or \ldots using the arms to counterbalance the new inertial forces as
part of the walking gait.

\section{Hardware Overview}
% Ok so, three pieces of hardware here, the Nao, the Lidar, and the mount.
% Technically, all you need is the Nao since it is a mobile base with distance sensors but the sonars
% don't do that great so we added the Lidar, and since there's no where to screw it down we designed a mount.

The hardware assembled for this platform can be divided into three major parts,
the Nao H25 Humanoid Platform, a Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 Lidar, and a custom 3D
printed assembly to mount the Lidar to the Nao.
The Nao acted as the mobile base and provided onboard sensing and computation. 
Its large number of degrees of freedom and humanoid configuration were amenable
to the exploration of crawling algorithms.
The Nao is also equipped with two color cameras for viewing the environment
and two sonars for measuring the range to objects.
% TODO: Maybe this should be restructured to highlight the roles the platform
% played in the Crawling and Navigation experiments, referenced by chapter.
In the navigation experiment, the forward facing camera was used to estimate
the pose to a goal object.
Though the two sonars can be used for obstacle
avoidance, previous experimentation showed they
were insufficient for navigation. This is because in a number of scenarios the
specular refections would cause confusing readings and the low angular
resolution would prevent the robot from walking through traversable apertures.
To supplement the Nao's sensor suite, the URG Lidar was mounted to the robot
to provide accurate, high resolution range data for use with navigation.
As the Nao does not have any external mounting points, a custom mount was
designed and constructed to allow the URG to be mounted to the Nao.
