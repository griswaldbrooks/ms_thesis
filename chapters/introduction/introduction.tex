\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}

\section{Concept and Motivation}
% We are trying to make things that help the robot get from A to B.
% The problem of getting the robot from A to B looks like this: stuff, stuff, stuff.
% A common task for robotic systems is for a mobile platform to transport itself from one location to another
% in the presence of environmental obstacles. Within this general task there are many subproblems. The system
% must have some sort of awareness of the destination objective and usually some notion of where it is relative
% to that destination. The destination location and the location of the robot can be encoded in a map that
% the mobile platform or some off board system is responsible for maintaining. Within the environment there may 
% be obstacles that prevent the robot from moving through that space which can also be encoded into the map. 
% Given these notions of robot, goal, and obstacle locations often an initial path is planned to allow the robot
% to reach the goal location. In addition to these higher level concepts, the robot must have a scheme by which it
% transports itself through the environment be rolling, walking, flying and controls for each of those methods.
% Solutions to these subproblems, map building, robot localization, obstacle localization,
% path planning, locomoting and others work together to accomplish the overall goal. 
% Each of these subproblems can be expanded upon and this thesis works on three of these components: 
% local navigation, obstacle detection and characterization, and gaiting. Used to work on these problems
% was the Nao Humanoid Platform by Aldebaran Robotics.

% What are we trying to get done here?
% Navigating a humanoid robot.
% Crawling a humanoid robot.
% Why are we trying to get these things done?
% Navigating is a fundamental thing for mobile robots.
% Crawling gives the robot another mode of locomotion and allows it to get to
% more places.

\section{Platform Overview}
% As a medium we worked with the Nao. The Nao is good because this: stuff, stuff, stuff.
% The broader task of moving an agent from one location to another is applicable to a wide range of robots but
% each platform will have details that change the scope of the problem and the method used to approach it.
% The three problems focused on (local navigation, obstacle detection, and gaiting) for a flying robot with 
% a global camera system will require different solutions than a wheeled robot with only rangefinders.
% For this thesis, the Nao H25 V4 Humanoid Platform by Aldebaran Robotics was chosen to act as the mobile base. 
% With the future goal of having robots interact in human environments, humanoid platforms have become an active
% area of research as they are physically compatible with such environments. 
% While Nao is a 1.9 ft tall humanoid weighing 9.5 lbs and therefore only an appropriate analog for a young human toddler,
% the humanoid format is of primary importance to algorithmic development\.
% with 25 degrees of freedom including two legs, two arms, and two grippers. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:nao_diagram1} shows a cursory illustration of the humanoid configuration.
% This lightweight but capable configuration enables research into mobile manipulation, humanoid gaiting, and terrain adaptation
% without the need for specialized support equipment such as belays or dedicated experimentation areas as the
% robot is safe for humans to interact with.

% The robot comes with a suite of sensors including two cameras, two ultrasonic rangefinders, 
% a 3-axis accelerometer and 2-axis gyro, foot contact sensors, and angular position encoders on every joint.
% Such a complement of sensors aids the robot in creating an estimate of a number of variables including 
% the robot state and environment characteristics. 
% Nao has a built-in WiFi radio and 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor running a version of the Linux operating system 
% allowing the robot to be programmed in C++ or Python using standard libraries that can be remotely uploaded.
% These features allow the use of a wide variety of tools when constructing new algorithms and for program
% iteration to happen at a rapid pace.
% 
% With all of these features the Nao makes for a convenient platform for the development of mobile robot algorithms.

% Then we stuck a Hokuyo laser on the Nao and used that for navigation. Why was this a good idea?
% To augment the sensor suite, a Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 Scanning Laser Rangefinder (Lidar) was mounted to the Nao and
% interfaced via a USB connection to the Nao's onboard computer. The sensor has a scanning area of $240^\circ$ with 
% an angular resolution of $0.36^\circ$ and a range of 5 meters. It is used to generate a planar point cloud representing
% the range to the nearest occlusion at a set of fixed bearing relative to the robot. Lidars are commonly used in mobile
% robotics so developing algorithms utilizing them is of practical concern.

% What equipment did we use?
% - Nao
% - Lidar
% - Mount
% Why did we use these things?

\section{Navigation}

% What approach did we go for?
% Why did we go for this?

\section{Crawl Gait}

% Many robots that enjoy practical use are not mobile. They are affixed to a table or floor
% and do not depend on their environment in order to produce a commanded movement. They 
% utilize a motion model that describes how their parts interact with each other to move an
% end effector and typically avoid interacting with objects in their environment other than those
% they are required to manipulate.
% Mobile robots also use a motion model to plan their movements but, in contrast to fixed robots, must interact
% with their environment to produce movement. 
% While this can be a more challenging problem than motion planning for fixed robots, the use of
% the environment to produce motion leads to mobile robots having a richer and more adaptable set of movements.
% Aerial and aquatic vehicles push against water or air,
% wheeled robots roll over the ground, legged robots walk, run, and crawl.
% Not only can mobile robots operate through a wider set of environments than fixed robots, but different
% actuation schemes can be employed to produce different movements. Legged robots are a particularly interesting
% platform for ground locomotion, as opposed to wheeled platforms, because they are more adaptable
% to a wide range of environments by actuating their legs according to a different strategy.
% Collectively, the method by which legged robots actuate their legs as a function of time is called 
% gaiting. Different gaits produce different characteristics such as the range of
% achievable speeds, endurance, terrain adaptability and a host of other things.

% Briefly, what's crawling?
% Why crawling?
% What approach did we go for?
% Why did we go for this approach?

\section{Thesis Structure}
This thesis is organized as follows:

% The navigation system is broken into three parts, 
% Chapter \ref{ch:navigation} discusses the GODZILA algorithm used for local navigation.
% Chapter \ref{ch:crawl_gait} discusses the Projected Profile crawling gait used to perform the crawl.
