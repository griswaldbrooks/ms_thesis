			I would like to thank Professor Farshad Khorrami for the guidance
            and opportunities given to me over the years, and throughout the 
            course of this thesis.
            Without question, had it not been for his motivation and 
            persistence, this thesis would not have come to fruition.

			I would also like to thank Dr. Krishnamurthy for his help
            understanding the more difficult concepts and providing inspiration
            when investigating new paths. Finally, thanks to my colleagues
            Brian Cairl and Agraj Jain for their help with implementation
            efforts and collaborations.
