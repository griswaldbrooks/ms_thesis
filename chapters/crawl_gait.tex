\chapter{Humanoid Crawl Gait} \label{ch:crawl_gait}

Using the Nao platform, crawling gaits applicable to humanoid robots was explored. 
Not only is crawling a more stable gaiting strategy than walking, but it gives the robot access to areas
of the environment that are inaccessible via walking alone. A low-profile laterally symmetric crawl gait is described, 
modeling the robot as a closed-chain manipulator with pseudo-static dynamics. This gait was parameterized on 
three joint variables and optimized using a cubic splines approach via a genetic algorithm.

As was described in Chapter \ref{ch:navigation}, the gaiting modality directly affects the navigation strategy.
By selecting the appropriate gaiting strategy, the robot can modify its movement to achieve a commanded goal.
This modified movement also modifies which environmental objects present as obstacles.
Expanding the library of gaits legged robots have access to allows robots to be increasingly more capable
and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.

\section{Humanoid Crawling}

Unlike walking and running which enjoy precise definitions, crawling seems to only have a subjective notion.
\cite{Dudek2000} asserts that crawling is a statically stable walk. This definition is problematic
as bipedal gaits have been demonstrated in \cite{figureoutacitation} that are statically stable but would not
be classified as crawling. In addition to this, soldiers performing the high army crawl \cite{armyfieldmanual2008} can be seen to
perform this motion very quickly which introduces a dynamic component to the crawl.
The standard or baby crawl is described as using one's hands and knees to produce forward motion.
In contrast to this, crawls such as the leopard, tiger, bear, and crab use hands and feet to produce
forward motion and the low army crawl uses the hands to drag and one leg to push the body across the ground.
Such diversity in crawling motion makes it difficult to differentiate a crawl from a statically stable
quadrupedal gait that uses something other than the end effectors to interact with the environment.
Despite this, the presented gait produces a motion that many would associate with humanoid crawling.

\subsection{Nao Crawling Limitations}

A primary limitation to the gaits that can be produced by the Nao is the limited number of degrees of freedom (DoF) of the platform
in contrast to the large number of DoF present in humans. While the Nao has 25 DoF, the human body has 244 \cite{zatsiorskybiomechanics}.
The human arm and leg each have 7 DoF while the Nao's arms and legs each have 5. 
Nao's hips have one more degree of freedom, called Hip Yaw-Pitch, which turn the legs together at an angle. 
Figure \ref{fig:nao_hips_legs1} illustrates this degree of freedom more clearly. 
The rest of the DoF of the Nao are in the hands and neck. 
Notably, Nao has no back joint. This prevents the gait designer from prescribing a twisting motion for use in the crawl gait.
These limits in motion preclude the execution of any gaits that require lateral twisting or sagittal arching.
Examples of this are shown in Figure \ref{fig:crawl_back1} .

\section{Projected Profile Humanoid Crawl Gait}

The crawling gait presented in this thesis is based on viewing the humanoid form as a set of manipulators on the
sagittal plane. Figure \ref{fig:nao_sideview1} illustrates this concept.
When the robot is laying in the prone position, it necessarily makes contact with the ground. If we then view the robot
from the side (looking at the sagittal plane) we can model it as a planar kinematic chain. If the chest and knees
are making contact with the ground, then the arms from the shoulder joint to the hand, and the legs from the knees to the
toes are free to move without affecting the rest of the body. This produces two open chain manipulators. In the case of the Nao, each has two degrees
of freedom in the sagittal pane, allowing the hands and feet to move independently.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nao_pp_sagittal_view1.png}
	\caption
	{Illustration of Projected Profile concept. Both panes show the saggital view of the Nao with a schematic representation of the kinematics. 
	In the top view, the robot appears as two open chain manipulators. In the bottom view, the robot appears as one closed chain manipulator.}
	\label{fig:nao_sideview1}
\end{figure}

If the elbows and toes are placed on the ground, then the body from the toes to the elbow can be viewed as a closed chain manipulator.
This allows the joints to work together to move the center of mass. Kinematically, these two phases share two common configurations.
The first configuration is when the elbow is at full extension and the toes touching the knees. We will call this the ``extension" configuration.
This can be viewed as the robot reaching forward. The second is when the elbow is at full flexion and the ankles at extension.
We will call this ``compression".
This can be viewed as the robot having pulled itself forward. These motions can then be combined
to produce a full gait.

Using the Nao robot as an example, Figure \ref{fig:nao_phases1} shows the full gaiting sequence.
The robot initializes itself in the open chain configuration. From this, it can position
its end effectors (the toes and elbows) into the first common configuration ``extension". Next, the robot is in the closed chain 
configuration in which it can transport its center of mass forward until it reaches the ``compression" configuration. Finally the robot
is again in the open chain configuration and the cycle can start again.

				pane moves the robot to the ``extension" configuration. The lower left

				robot, having translated forward, once again in the open chain configuration.
				A 6-inch marker is shown in the background as a length scale reference.}
	\label{fig:nao_phases1}
\end{figure}

The gait is laterally symmetric. 
If we actuate the joints at an appropriate rate, dynamic effects from the robot's motion do not become a significant factor.
As detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:results}, this gait can be performed on the Nao at a speed of 1 ft every 6 to 8 seconds. 
The wide surface area of the forearm provides a high coefficient of friction against slipping and the small surface area of
the toes can act as a point of high pressure which can dig into soft surfaces such as carpets.
The gait is statically stable in the sense that the robot's motion can be paused at any point and the robot will maintain that pose.
The gait does not depend on the robot
sliding along the surface nor does it highly depend on surface friction to pull the robot forward.
The gait has a very low profile. The highest point on the robot during the gait (which is the top of the head)
is about 8 inches off of the ground. In contrast, during walking, the Nao robot stands 23 inches tall.

\subsection{Open Chain Kinematics}
The Projected Profile crawl gait has two kinematic configurations: open chain and closed chain. In the open chain
configuration, the robot acts as two independent planar manipulators. 
Each manipulator has two degrees of freedom as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:open_chain1} .

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stick_open_chain_rough1.png}
	\caption
	{Simplified kinematic model of the sagittal projection of the open chain configuration.
	The manipulator on the left represents the tibia-foot chain. The manipulator on the right
	represents the humerus-forearm chain. The origin of the knee and shoulder are represented as 
	having a z-axis offset because the knee and chest of the robot have heights that raise their 
	origins.}
	\label{fig:open_chain1}
\end{figure}

With the Nao facing downwards, the feet towards the origin and the head in the positive x direction, 
the forward kinematics for each manipulator are described by:
\begin{align}
	x &= x_0 + l_1 cos(\theta_1) + l_2 cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
	z &= z_0 + l_1 sin(\theta_1) + l_2 sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{align}
where $x_0$ and $z_0$ are the superior and posterior offsets with respect to the global frame, respectively. $l_1$ is the length of the
humerus/tibia, $l_2$ is the length of the forearm/foot, $\theta_1$ is the angle subtended by the 
shoulder/knee and the x-axis, and $\theta_2$ is the angle subtended by the ankle/elbow and the x-axis of the humerus/tibia.

The solutions to the inverse kinematics problem can be seen as:

\begin{align}
	\theta_2 &= \cos^{-1} \left (\frac{(x - x_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 l_1 l_2} \right ) \label{eq:open_fk_eq1}\\
	\theta_1 &= 2 \tan^{-1} \left (\frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \right ) \label{eq:open_fk_eq2}\\
	A &= (x - x_0) + (z - z_0) + l_1 + l_2 (\cos(\theta_2) + \sin(\theta_2)) \\
	B &= -2(l_1 + l_2(\cos(\theta_2) - \sin(\theta_2)) \\
	C &= (x - x_0) + (z - z_0) - l_1 - l_2 (\cos(\theta_2) + \sin(\theta_2))
\end{align}

This solution derives from the standard inverse kinematics procedure of inverting the forward kinematics.
$\theta_1$ must be chosen such that no part of the robot tries to intersect with the floor. 
In practice, the two argument arc-tangent function $atan2$ is used instead of $\tan^{-1}$ .

\subsection{Closed Chain Kinematics} \label{subsec:crawl_closed_chain}

The closed chain configuration models the toes and elbows of the robot as being fixed to the ground.
As with all closed chain kinematics, describing the forward kinematics requires solving an inverse
kinematics equation. Modeling the robot in the same orientation as the open chain, with the toe at the origin
and neglecting the thickness of the elbow,
the forward kinematics of the closed chain are:

\begin{align}
	d_e &= \sum_{i=1}^5 l_i \cos(\sum_{j=1}^i \theta_j) \label{eq:fk_eq1}\\
	0 &= \sum_{i=1}^5 l_i \sin(\sum_{j=1}^i \theta_j) \label{eq:fk_eq2} \\
	\alpha &=\sum_{i=1}^5 \theta_i \label{eq:fk_eq3}
\end{align}
where $d_e$ is the prescribed distance of the elbow from the foot and $\alpha$ is the desired angle
created by the x-axis of the humerus and the ground.
$\theta_1$ through $\theta_5$ are the angles of the following joints with respect to their previous links when projected onto the sagittal plane:
toe-to-ground, ankle, knee, hip, shoulder. In Figure \ref{fig:pp_stick1}, the red lines represent the links projected onto the sagittal plane.
These equations are the standard planar manipulation equations, treating the foot as the base link 
with the elbow as the end effector.
Equation \ref{eq:fk_eq1} constrains the end effector to be a set distance from the foot and 
equation \ref{eq:fk_eq2} constrains the end effector to be on the ground.
Using equation \ref{eq:fk_eq3}, equations \ref{eq:fk_eq1} and \ref{eq:fk_eq2} can be rewritten as:

\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^4 l_i \cos(\sum_{j=1}^i \theta_j) &= d_e - l_5 \cos(\alpha) \label{eq:sum_cos1} \\
\sum_{i=1}^4 l_i \sin(\sum_{j=1}^i \theta_j) &= - l_5 \sin(\alpha). \label{eq:sum_sin1}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stick3_with_notation1.png}
	\caption
	{Simplified kinematic model of the sagittal projection of the closed chain configuration.}
	\label{fig:pp_stick1}
\end{figure}

If $\theta_3$, $\theta_4$, and $\alpha$ are prescribed angles, then equations \ref{eq:sum_cos1} and \ref{eq:sum_sin1} are two equations 
in the two unknowns $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. 
$\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ can be constant or time-varying as the resultant configuration is a function of 
these two ``free'' variables.
Taking the square of each of the equations \ref{eq:sum_cos1} and \ref{eq:sum_sin1}, 
an equation in the single variable $\theta_2$ is obtained as:
\begin{align}
	2l_1 K_1 \cos(\theta_2) + 2l_1K_2 \sin(\theta_2) &= [d_e - l_5 \cos(\alpha)]^2 + [l_5 \sin(\alpha)]^2 - l_1^2 - K_1^2 - K_2^2 \label{eq:theta2_eq1} \\
	K_1 &= l_2 + l_3 \cos(\theta_3) + l_4 \cos(\theta_3 + \theta_4) \label{eq:theta2_eq2}\\
	K_2 &= -l_3 \sin(\theta_3) - l_4 \sin(\theta_3 + \theta_4) \label{eq:theta2_eq3}
\end{align}

The solution to equation \ref{eq:theta2_eq1} is of similar form to that seen in \ref{eq:open_fk_eq2}.
In general, there will be two solutions for $\theta_2$, but one of them will cause the robot to collide
with the ground and must be guarded against.
With $\theta_2$ solved, equations \ref{eq:sum_cos1} and \ref{eq:sum_sin1} can be used to solve for $\theta_1$:
\begin{align}
	\theta_1 = tan^{-1} \left( \frac{sin(\theta_1)}{cos(\theta_1)} \right ) \label{eq:theta1_eq1}\\
	cos(\theta_1) = \frac{K_3 (d_e - l_5 \cos(\alpha)) + l_5 K_4 \sin(\alpha)}{K_3^2 + K_4^2} \label{eq:theta1_eq2}\\
	sin(\theta_1) = \frac{K_4 (d_e - l_5 \cos(\alpha)) - l_5 K_3 \sin(\alpha)}{K_3^2 + K_4^2} \label{eq:theta1_eq3}\\
	K_3 = l_1 + K_1 cos(\theta_2) + K_2 sin(\theta_2) \label{eq:theta1_eq4}\\
	K_4 = K_2 cos(\theta_2) - K_1 sin(\theta_2) \label{eq:theta1_eq5}
\end{align}

Lastly, $\theta_5$ is solved using equation \ref{eq:fk_eq3}.

% Robot is like a parallelogram. Any robot that can make a parallelogram can use this principle.
With these angles solved, the entire robot is parameterized on three angles $\theta_3, \theta_4, \alpha$.
If $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ are fixed, then starting with the elbow at full extension, bringing the elbow
to flexion moves the robot forward. This corresponds to $\alpha$ starting with a small negative angle and 
ending with a large negative angle. 
For the Nao, $\alpha$ is initialized at approximately $-30^\circ$ and terminates at about $-90^\circ$ .
The primary intuition about this procedure is that the closed chain is like a parallelogram that is used to shift
the mass of the robot. Any robot (humanoid or not) that can be set into this configuration can use this 
framework in order to gait the robot.

\subsection{Nao Kinematics} \label{subsec:nao_kinematics}
Once the projected profile time sequence of angles has been computed, it needs to be applied to the Nao.
Figure \ref{fig:nao_pp_view1} illustrates the sagittal view of the robot in the closed chain configuration.
When Nao is set to this configuration, the ankle pitch, knee pitch, hip pitch, and shoulder pitch joints 
of the robot directly correspond to $\theta_2$ through $\theta_5$. $\theta_1$ corresponds to the angle
subtended by the robot's foot and the ground. Unlike the first five joint angles, angle $\alpha$ does not have a
direct correspondence. The arm joint angles must be derived as a relationship between the angle $\alpha$ and additional
arm positioning constraints.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{horz_profile_with_notation2.png}

  	\label{fig:nao_pp_view1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  	\caption{Diagram showing the arm joints of the Nao Humanoid Platform.

  					 of the right arm configuration. Cite Aldebaran Nao documentation.
  				  }
  	\label{fig:nao_rarm_hardware1}
\end{figure}

The coordinate frame that all of the calculations will be done with respect to, will be embedded in the
saggital plane $n_p$ of the Nao. The x-axis is embedded in the saggital plane and in the direction of travel, parallel to the crawling surface. The z-axis is also embedded in the saggital place, perpendicular to the x-axis
and pointing upwards.
The y-axis is perpendicular to the saggital plane. Nominally, the axis of the shoulder pitch is coincident
with the y-axis. The origin of the coordinate system will be at the shoulder pitch joint.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:nao_rarm_hardware1}, the arm of the Nao has 5 degrees of freedom.
The kinematic chain of the arm joints proceeds in the following order: shoulder pitch, shoulder
roll, elbow yaw, elbow roll, wrist yaw. The angles for these joints will be denoted as $\theta_{sp}$,
$\theta_{sr}$, $\theta_{ey}$, $\theta_{er}$, and $\theta_{wy}$ respectively. Due to the projected profile
method being a saggital projection of the Nao's kinematic configuration, and the shoulder pitch joint
being orthogonal to the saggital plane, $\theta_{sp} = \theta_5$ as stated previously. The wrist
joint plays no role in the positioning of the arm in this context (as the hand orientation is considered
not to be relevant), therefore, $\theta_{wy}$ is not a function of the projected profile angle set.
The remaining joint angles $\theta_{sr}$, $\theta_{ey}$, and $\theta_{er}$ 
need to be solved for using the projected profile angle $\alpha$ and the following arm positioning 
constraints.

% We want to be able to position the arms a certain width apart to give a wider base and allow the elbows to
% rotate the projection of the forearm more before the actual forearm hits the humerus.
While the arms could be positioned such that $\theta_{sr}$ and $\theta_{ey}$ are set to a constant
and $\theta_{er}$ corresponds to $\alpha$, this configuration limits the lateral stability of the
gait. To increase the lateral stability, the arms are positioned so the forearm-to-forearm distance $d_f$
is greater than the shoulder-to-shoulder distance $d_s$. This increases the width of the support polygon 
that the center of mass can be projected onto. A diagram of these distances can be seen in 
Figure \ref{fig:nao_arm_pose1}.

\begin{figure}

  	\label{fig:nao_arm_pose1}
\end{figure}

% [More to come on this part. Continue reading.]
% This is the part where we talk about the arm kinematics.
% Unlike the feet, etc, the arms are not inline with the rest of the body.

% The shoulder roll is computable as a function of the desired width, shoulder width, and the length of the humerus.
% The shoulder roll $\theta_{sr}$ is computable as a function of 
As the shoulder roll only proceeds the shoulder pitch, its value $\theta_{sr}$ can be computed as a function
of $d_s$, $d_f$ and the length of the humerus $l_h$. A scalar $d = \frac{d_f - d_s}{2}$ is
the distance in the y-axis that the elbow extends from the origin.
From the geometry of the arm positioning, it can be seen that $\theta_{sr}$ can be computed as:

\begin{equation}
	\theta_{sr} = sin^{-1} \left( \frac{d}{l_h} \right ) \label{eq:shoulder_roll1}
\end{equation}

% The elbow roll is a function of the humerus vector and the desired forearm direction vector.
% The elbow yaw is a function of the humerus vector, the desired forearm direction vector, and the axis of rotation
% the the elbow roll revolves around.

Intuitively, the elbow yaw and elbow roll are a function of the vector $u_f$, which represents the desired 
orientation of the forearm, the vector $v_f$, which is the orientation of the forearm when 
$\theta_{ey}$ and $\theta_{er}$ are zero, and the two vectors representing the axes of joint 
rotation about the two elbow joints,
denoted $v_{ey}$ and $v_{er}$. $v_f$ is first rotated about $v_{ey}$ by amount $\theta_{ey}$, then about
$v_{er}$ by amount $\theta_{er}$. This should bring $v_f$ to be conincident with $u_f$.
This can be expressed by equation \ref{eq:elbow_fk1}.

\begin{equation}
	u_f = R_{v_{er}, \theta_{er}} R_{v_{ey}, \theta_{ey}} v_f \label{eq:elbow_fk1}
\end{equation}

When the joint angles are zero, $v_f = v_{ey}$.
% The first vector is the desired forearm orientation $u_f = [1, 0, 0]^T$. We want the forearm to lie on the ground
% and pointing forward.
The desired orientation of the forearm is to be along the direction of travel to maximize the static friction
in that direction. $u_f$ is therefore coincident with the x-axis $u_f = [1, 0, 0]^T$.

% The next vector is the unit vector representing the direction that the humerus is pointing.
% $v_{ey} = [\tilde l_h \cos(\alpha), d, \tilde l_h \sin(\alpha)]^T / l_h$.
% As can be seen by Figure \ref{fig:nao_arm_vectors1} $[\tilde l_h \cos(\alpha), d, \tilde l_h \sin(\alpha)]^T$ 
% represents
% the humerus with the shoulder at the origin, which is then normalized by the length of the humerus $l_h$.

As $v_{ey}$ is coincident with the humerus, it can be found by computing the normalized humerus vector.
An illustration of this vector can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:arm_vectors1}. The elbow yaw axis is then defined
by equation \ref{eq:elbow_yaw_axis1}.
\begin{equation}
	v_{ey} = [\tilde l_h \cos(\alpha), d, \tilde l_h \sin(\alpha)]^T / l_h \label{eq:elbow_yaw_axis1}
\end{equation}

$\tilde l_h = \sqrt{l_h^2 - d^2}$ is the length of the humerus, projected onto the z-x plane.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nao_arm_vector_z_x_y1.png}
  	\caption{Diagram illustrating the vector $v_{ey}$. The left pane shows the vector in
  					 the z-x plane and its z and x components as functions of $\tilde l_h$ and $\alpha$.
  					 $\alpha$ is defined as being the angle subtended by the humerus in the z-x plane and the
  					 ground plane, but as the ground plane is parallel to the x-axis in this derivation
  					 $\alpha$ can be used to describe $v_{ey}$.
  					 The right pane shows the vector in the z-y plane and its y component as $d$.
  				  }
  	\label{fig:arm_vectors1}
\end{figure}

% The next vector is the unit vector representing the rotation axis for the elbow roll joint on the Nao.
% When the elbow yaw is zero, the rotation axis for the elbow roll is $v_{er} = [-\sin(\alpha), 0, \cos(\alpha)]^T$.
% This vector $v_{er}$ is perpendicular to $v_{ey}$.
By the kinematics of Nao's arm, $v_{er}$ will always lie on the plane perpendicular to the vector $v_{ey}$.
As $\theta_{ey}$ can be offset to make $v_{er}$ any vector on that plane, $v_{er}$ is chosen to be:

\begin{equation}
	v_{er} = [-\sin(\alpha), 0, \cos(\alpha)]^T
\end{equation}

which is perpendicular to $v_{ey}$ by construction.

% The goal here is to put the forearm to be $u_f$. When elbow yaw and elbow roll are zero, the orientation of the
% forearm is coincident with the vector $v_{ey}$. We will denote the forearm vector as $v_f$ which is initialized to
% $v_f = v_{ey}$.
% In order to move $v_f$ to $u_f$ we have to rotate $v_f$ around $v_{ey}$ by an amount $\theta_{ey}$ and then about
% $v_{er}$ by an amount $\theta_{er}$.

% To find $\theta_{ey}$, we must first compute $v_f \times u_f$ to find the desired vector $u_{er}$ that
% $v_{er}$ must be rotated to. Then, $\theta_{ey} = \arccos(v_{er} \cdot u_{er})$.
To find $\theta_{ey}$,  it is necessary to find the vector $u_{er}$ to which $v_{er}$ must be rotated, to allow
$v_f$ to be brought to $u_f$. $u_{er}$ can be found by taking the cross product of $v_f$ and $u_f$.
Then, $\theta_{ey}$ is the inverse cosine of the dot product of $v_{er}$ and $u_{er}$ as they are all unit vectors.
\begin{align}
	u_{er} &= v_f \times u_f \\
	\theta_{ey} &= \cos^{-1}(v_{er} \cdot u_{er})
\end{align}

% Then, $\theta_{er} = \arccos(v_{ey} \cdot u_f)$.
Finally, $\theta_{er}$ is the angle between the forearm vector $v_f$ and the desired forearm vector $u_f$.
This can again be found using the inverse cosine and dot product.

\begin{equation}
	\theta_{er} = \cos^{-1}(v_{f} \cdot u_{f})
\end{equation}

% These four angles complete the arm kinematics and compute the joints angles given the projected profile angle $\alpha$
% and the desired forearm-to-forearm spacing.

\section{Optimization} \label{sec:crawl_optimization}

In the previous section, the Projected Profile crawl gait was parameterized on angle triplet 
$[ \theta_3, \theta_4, \alpha ]$ .
To achieve a crawling gait, $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ can be set to be constant and $\alpha$ linearly incremented
from an initial angle to a final angle as a function of time. While this configuration successfully gaits the robot,
it is heuristic. To improve the approach, the selection of a triplet of cubic splines 
$[\theta_3(t), \theta_4(t), \alpha(t)]$ is considered as an optimization problem. 
While many different quantities such as gait speed or the levelness of the back 
(for transportation of payloads) could be considered as optimization metrics, in this thesis the energy usage was 
minimized via joint torque measurements.
The aim was to increase the amount of time the crawling gait could be performed and reduce the stress on the robot's joints.

\subsection{Pseudo-static Model} \label{subsec:crawl_pseudo_static_model}

In order to optimize the gait with respect to the joint torques of the robot, a dynamic model of the robot is required.
As the Projected Profile crawl gait is conceived as a statically stable gait and performed at slow speeds,
the dynamics due to the movement of the robot are not considered to be forces that the 
motor controllers must counteract. 
During any part of the gait the robot will not slide if the gaiting direction is orthogonal to gravity and
if the robot were to relax its joints it would collapse.
Considering this, the resultant joint torques can be seen to be a function of gravity. 
This pseudo-static model of the robot can then be used to produce a cost metric for the optimization procedure.
While conceptually simple, analyzing the projected profile closed chain manipulator to produce the 
system dynamics is challenging.
In lieu of this, the robot was simulated for different values of the angle triplet in the closed chain 
configuration to generate a table of torques. This table of torques is then interpolated to produce
a model of joint torques as a function of the parameterized angles:
\begin{equation}
	[\tau_2, \tau_2, \tau_4, \tau_5] = jointTorques(\theta_3, \theta_4, \alpha)
\end{equation}
where $\tau_2, \tau_3, \tau_4, \tau_5$ are the torques of one of the ankles, knees, hips, and shoulders, respectively.
In this case, only one of each of the joints is considered because the gait is laterally symmetric. This means
the torque of the left joint should be the same of the right joint.
$\tau_1$ is not a product of the function as $\theta_1$ is not an actuated joint.

The V-REP simulator by Coppelia Robotics was used to gather joint torque data. It uses the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
as its dynamics solver and is distributed with a model of the Nao Humanoid Platform. The model of the Nao
kinematically corresponds with the Nao V4 and has the same mass values for the links. 
The Nao V4 is the robot used in this thesis.
It has an easy to use API that can interface with C++, Python, or MATLAB.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:nao_vrep1} shows a screen capture of the Nao model in the V-REP simulator. 
The Nao was configured to be in the closed chain and set to different joints angles. 
The initial and final values of $\alpha$ were constrained due to the gaiting requirement of the elbow to start at 
extension and end at flexion. The ranges of $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ were defined according to what seemed
like plausible knee and hip angles for the gait. Using these limits a discrete set of triplets were defined
at a $2.5^\circ$ resolution for each triplet parameter. These triplets were sent through the kinematics equations to produce the joint
commands for the simulated Nao robot. 
Table \ref{tab:angle_set_params1} lists the parameters that describe the triplets tested. In total, 9,975
different joint configurations were simulated.
To allow for the effect of
any dynamics generated by the change in configuration to settle, the torque values of each of the joints was recorded
after a period of one second.

\subsection{Cost Functions} \label{subsec:cost_functions}

To find the optimal parameters for the angle triplet splines $[\theta_3(t), \theta_4(t), \alpha(t)]$, 
a cost $c_s$ has to be attributable to a given spline triplet as a function of the spline parameters.
The cost function contains terms regarding the joint torques given by the pseudo-static model, as
the primary goal of the optimization procedure is to reduce the overall usage of torque
(and therefore energy) of the gait. Additionally, a number of indicator functions
were introduced to the cost function in order to ensure kinematic constraints were not violated
and to deter problems with the algorithm's implementation, which will be discussed.

The cost function based on joint torques was computed as:
\begin{equation}
	c_{\tau}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^4 w_i \tau_i^2(t) \label{eq:cost_joint}
\end{equation}

In this notation, $\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3, \tau_4$ are the torques of the ankle, knee, hip, and shoulder, respectively.
These torques are taken from the pseudo-static model and, as stated, are a function of 
$\alpha(t), \theta_3(t),$ and $\theta_4(t)$.
The weight vector is constant and equal to $w = [1, 1, 1, 5]^T$.
$w_4$ has a higher value in order to reduce the use of Nao's shoulder, as its actuator can produce about 3 to 4 times
less torque than each of the leg actuators.

The first set of indicator functions introduced deter violation of kinematic constrains, such as joint limits
in $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ \ref{eq:fn_ind_theta}, starting and stopping conditions for $\alpha$ \ref{eq:fn_ind_alpha},
and to prevent the Nao from being in a kinematic configuration where the hips are making contact with the crawling
surface \ref{eq:fn_ind_z}.

\begin{align}
	c_{\theta_i}(t) &=
  	\begin{cases} 
  		\hfill 1 \hfill & \text{ if $\theta_i (t) > \theta_{i_{max}}$ or $\theta_i (t) < \theta_{i_{min}}$ } \\
    	\hfill 0 \hfill & \text{ otherwise }
  	\end{cases} \label{eq:fn_ind_theta} \\
  c_{\alpha}(t) &=
  	\begin{cases} 
    	\hfill 1 \hfill & \text{ if $\alpha(t) > \alpha_{max}$ or $\alpha(t) < \alpha_{min}$ } \\
      \hfill 0 \hfill & \text{ otherwise }
  	\end{cases} \label{eq:fn_ind_alpha} \\
	c_{z_{hip}}(t) &=
  	\begin{cases} 
    	\hfill 1 \hfill & \text{ if $z_{hip}(t) < z_{hip_{thresh}}$ } \\
      \hfill 0 \hfill & \text{ otherwise }
  	\end{cases} \label{eq:fn_ind_z}
\end{align}

The function $z_{hip}(t)$ returns the height of the hips at time $t$ using the the forward kinematics of the
closed chain model of the gait. $z_{hip_{thresh}} \ne 0$, and is chosen to be the height of the hip joint when
the robot is touching the crawling surface.

The next indicator function exists to deter a problem observed with the gaits being produced. 
Experimentally, it was seen that the optimizer would produce splines in which the parameter
$\alpha$ would, for a large part of the gait, either stay nearly stationary or increase for some time, before
decreasing by a large amount.
To review, $\alpha$ is initialized at approximately $-30^\circ$ and terminates at about $-90^\circ$.
This appeared as the robot lunging forward at the end of the gait.
This can most readily intepreted as the robot incurring a large cost for a small time, which is perhaps
a local optima. An indicator function \ref{eq:fn_ind_dalpha} was added to penalize splines in which 
$\alpha (t)$ was not monotonically decreasing, which allowed the optimizer to find a more efficient gait.

\begin{equation} 
	c_{\dot \alpha}(t) =
  	\begin{cases} 
    	\hfill 1 \hfill & \text{ if $\dot \alpha(t) \ge 0$ } \\
      \hfill 0 \hfill & \text{ otherwise }
  	\end{cases} \label{eq:fn_ind_dalpha}
\end{equation}

The indicator functions are then summed and multiplied by a large constant $C_v$ so that the cost to
violate any of these constraints is prohibitively large.

\begin{equation}
	c_I(t) = C_v \Big( c_{\dot \alpha}(t) + c_{\alpha}(t) + c_{z_{hip}}(t) + \sum_3^4 c_{\theta_i}(t) \Big) \label{eq:cost_ind}
\end{equation}

The cost of the spline triplet is then given by integrating the sum of cost functions \ref{eq:cost_joint} and
\ref{eq:cost_ind}, and can be seen in equation \ref{eq:cost_spline}.

\begin{equation}
c_s = \int_0^T c_{\tau}(t) + c_I(t) \, dt \label{eq:cost_spline}
\end{equation}

where $T$ is equal to one second, as it was seen that this was a reasonable time frame for this phase of the gait
to be performed. 

\subsection{Optimization Procedure} \label{subsec:crawl_opt_procedure}

The optimization procedure used to optimize the spline triplet $[\theta_3(t), \theta_4(t), \alpha(t)]$
was a basic genetic algorithm implemented using the genetic algorithm functions available in the MATLAB 
Global Optimization Toolbox. 

Briefly, genetic algorithm optimization works by first creating a ``population'' of
possible solutions, in this case the parameters for the spline triplet. Then the ``fitness'' of each solution
is determined, here by evaluating the cost function for the solution. Finally, the solutions that are more fit
are ``selected'' to for the ``parent'' set. These parents are then ``bred'' to form a new set of ``child'' solutions
which will then be evaluated again. After some number of ``generations'', the most fit solution is selected
as the optimal solution.

Genetic algorithms are well suited for problems like this as more classical optimization techniques
would require the cost function to be analytical, which the joint torque table is not.
As a result, because there is so much freedom in the cost function, different functions can be tried
and evaluated to find a suitable result.
Lastly, because the gait design problem presented in this thesis, was not required to run in real time on the
Nao, using such a computationally heavy optimization technique did not impact gait performance.
One pitfall to this technique is there is no guarantee that the global optima will be found for
a given cost function and therefore local optima are still possible to be returned.

Using the cost function presented in Section \ref{subsec:cost_functions}, the genetic algorithm was used
to find the 12 triplet parameters (4 parameters for each cubic spline). %The algorithm ran for 67 generations
% and produced a triplet spline whose cost was approximately six times smaller than the nominal strategy
% of holding $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$ constant while linearly increasing $\alpha$.
Details on the results of this optimization can be found in Chapter \ref{subsec:gait_params}.
