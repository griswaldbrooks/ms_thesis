\chapter{Navigation Results} \label{ch:results_navigation}

% The structure of this chapter needs revision.

% What do we have to talk about here?
% Well, I suppose the point of this chapter is to present how well the algorithm worked.
% What is there to present?
% I suppose it should be shown that the algorithm does indeed nav the robot,
% as that is not necessarily assumed in the chapter explaining the navigation.
% Some things you might want to know:
% Qualitatively, how well did it nav the robot?

% Ok, so what can I show?
% I can show pictures of the Nao naving around different environments getting to goals
% I can show what the robot thought his pose was based on the goal.
% I can list the optimal parameters for naving.
% I wish I could have shown laser data, because maybe I could have shown a potential field map.
% Can I show the different parts of what the nav was using? No, because the straight line planner
% and escape strategy was not implemented.
